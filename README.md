# CoreDataModeller

Xcode projects requiring local storage often use [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdTechnologyOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009296-SW1). 

The purpose of CoreDataModeller is to provide a graphical modelling tool similar to the one provided in an .xcdatamodeld file in Xcode and to automatically generate code for a data model that can be used in an Xcode project.
